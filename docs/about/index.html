    <p>Speedcubing is the practice of solving twisty puzzles, such as the Rubik’s Cube, as quickly as possible. Over the years, it has evolved into a competitive sport with a global community of cubers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-wca">What is the WCA?</h2>

<p>The <strong>World Cube Association (WCA)</strong> is the governing body for official speedcubing competitions worldwide. It sets the rules and regulations for events and maintains official records and rankings for competitors. The WCA oversees various puzzle events, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3x3x3 Cube</strong> (the standard Rubik’s Cube event)</li>
  <li><strong>2x2x2 Cube</strong></li>
  <li><strong>4x4x4 Cube</strong></li>
  <li><strong>One-Handed Solving</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Blindfolded Solving</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Megaminx, Pyraminx, and Skewb</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fewest Moves Challenge</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-cubing-competitions-work">How Do Cubing Competitions Work?</h2>

<p>Cubing competitions are organized according to WCA regulations and typically follow this structure:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Registration</strong> – Competitors sign up in advance and check in on the day of the event.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspection &amp; Solving</strong> – Each competitor gets a limited time to inspect the cube before starting their solve.</li>
  <li><strong>Timed Solving</strong> – Using a stackmat timer, competitors complete multiple solves, and their times are recorded.</li>
  <li><strong>Averaging</strong> – Most events use an average of five solves (excluding the fastest and slowest) to determine rankings.</li>
  <li><strong>Finals &amp; Awards</strong> – The best performers progress to final rounds, and winners receive awards or recognition.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-participate-in-competitions">Why Participate in Competitions?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Community</strong> – Meet and connect with fellow cubers.</li>
  <li><strong>Improvement</strong> – Compete against others to enhance your skills.</li>
  <li><strong>Records &amp; Achievements</strong> – Have your times officially recorded by the WCA.</li>
  <li><strong>Fun &amp; Challenge</strong> – Experience the thrill of competitive cubing!</li>
</ul>
