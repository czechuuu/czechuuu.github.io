## Event History


The Megaminx or Mégaminx (/ˈmɛɡəmɪŋks/, /ˈmeɪ-/) is a dodecahedron-shaped puzzle similar to the Rubik's Cube. It has a total of 50 movable pieces to rearrange, compared to the 20 movable pieces of the Rubik's Cube.

The Megaminx, or Magic Dodecahedron, was invented by several people independently and produced by several different manufacturers with slightly different designs. Uwe Mèffert eventually bought the rights to some of the patents and continues to sell it in his puzzle shop under the Megaminx moniker.[1] It is also known by the name Hungarian Supernova, invented by Dr. Christoph Bandelow.[2] His version came out first, shortly followed by Mèffert's Megaminx. The proportions of the two puzzles are slightly different. The Supernova is cut in such a way that the cuts on each face meet at the edges, forming a pentagram. Mèffert's Megaminx has somewhat wider edges relative to the corners.
