## Event History
In 2003, the first Rubik’s Cube competition since the televised 1982 World Championships was organised by the team that would later form the World Cube Association. This competition held a variety of weird and wonderful events, most of which are still held at competitions all around the world to this date. One of these events was 3x3x3 One Handed (abbreviated to OH). This involved solving the puzzle in the same way that a competitor would speedsolve a Rubik’s Cube normally, except with only the use of one hand. This event has received worldwide interest, and every day becomes more and more competitive. Here, we will take a look at the history of the much-loved event and how the both methods and times have improved throughout its lifetime.

In the early days of the one-handed event, progress was relatively slow due to the poor quality of the puzzles available at the time. At the first competitions, the best solvers clocked in times of just over 40 seconds. After these competitions improvement was rapid at first but continuously steady. By the end of 2004, Chris Hardwick had lowered the single World Record to 25.95 seconds and Shotaro Makisumi had the average record of 39.25 seconds. By the end of the following year, the single was even lower at 22.05 seconds and the average had dropped drastically to mid-26 seconds. By this point in history, competitions were starting to pop up all over the World, with 2007 seeing over 50 competitions worldwide, so even more speedsolvers were starting to get the chance to compete. Also around this time there were some relatively simple speedcubes available to the dedicated solvers (although these puzzles are incredibly poor in comparison to those of the current year), and the launch of the Speedsolving forums in 2006 led to the sharing of ideas, modifications, lubricants etc. which all contributed to the improvement of times. By the end of the decade, the single and average World Records had approached times deemed incredible for two handed solves just a few years back.
