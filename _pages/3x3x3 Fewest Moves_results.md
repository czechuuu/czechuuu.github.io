## Event History
Fewest Moves (or Fewest Moves Challenge, FMC) is an event where competitors attempt to solve a puzzle (almost always the 3x3x3) in as few moves as possible, starting from a given scramble. The usual turn metric is HTM.

There is one WCA-official Fewest Moves event: writing down the shortest possible solution to a 3x3x3 scramble, with a time limit of one hour. Other types of fewest move solving have been tried in the Fewest Moves Challenge, with the most popular other events being the Linear Fewest Moves event (solving the 3x3x3 with as few moves as possible, without being able to undo moves) and the event of writing down the shortest possible solution for the 3x3x3 with a time limit of one week.

The original Fewest Moves Challenge (FMC) was a challenge started by Dan Harris. It was the first online Fewest Moves competition and, although it is no longer run by Dan, it remains a good way to practice fewest moves solving. One scramble is given per event every week, and the results are typically up soon after the next round starts.
