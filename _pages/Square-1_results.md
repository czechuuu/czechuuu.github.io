## Event History
The Square-1 is a variant of the Rubik's Cube. Its distinguishing feature among the numerous Rubik's Cube variants is that it can change shape as it is twisted, due to the way it is cut, thus adding an extra level of challenge and difficulty. The Super Square One and Square Two puzzles have also been introduced. The Super Square One has two additional layers that can be scrambled and solved independently of the rest of the puzzle, and the Square Two has extra cuts made to the top and bottom layer, making the edge and corner wedges the same size.

The Square-1 (full name "Back to Square One") or alternatively, "Cube 21", was invented by Karel Hršel and Vojtěch Kopský in 1990. Application for a Czechoslovak patent was filed on 8 November 1990, then filed as a "priority document" on January 1, 1991. The patent was finally approved on 26 October 1992, with patent number CS277266 [3] Archived 2018-04-05 at the Wayback Machine. On March 16, 1993, the object itself was patented in the US with patent number US5,193,809 [4] then its design was also patented, on October 5, 1993, with patent number D340,093.

The Square-1 consists of three layers. The upper and lower layers contain kite and triangular pieces. They are also called corner and edge pieces, respectively. There are altogether 8 kite and 8 triangular pieces. The kite pieces are 60 degrees wide, while the triangular pieces are 30 degrees wide, relative to the center of the layer.
