## Event History
The Pocket Cube (also known as the Mini Cube and Twizzle) is a 2×2×2 combination puzzle invented in 1970 by American puzzle designer Larry D. Nichols.[1] The cube consists of 8 pieces, which are all corners.

In February 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2×2×2 "Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together with magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. patent 3,655,201 on April 11, 1972, two years before Rubik invented the 3×3×3 cube.

Nichols assigned his patent to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued Ideal in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals court affirmed the judgment that Rubik's 2×2×2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols's patent, but overturned the judgment on Rubik's 3×3×3 Cube.[2]
